Whole design was inspired from the book 'Digital design and computer architecture.'
Single-cycle MIPS processor supporting all the instruction including addi and j. ALU can support seven operations such as AND, OR, +, -, SLT, AND with ~B, OR with ~B. \

Assembly code can be updated on memfile.dat. sample assembly code is given below for testbecnch.
